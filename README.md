# biron

Biron is an open source soldering iron hardware based on Baxandall Oscillator. This is a homebrew project that I am doing during the free time at home.

## Software Requirements

* KiCAD v6.0.11 or above to view the schematic and PCB files.
* LTSpice 17.1.6.0 or above to view the SPICE simulation.

## Disclaimer

This is an open source project that involves high voltage and hot surfaces. You must have enough experience to build it in real life and wear PPE, I don't want people get hurt.
